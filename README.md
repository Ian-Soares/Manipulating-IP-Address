# Manipulating-IP-Address
This project contains some of my progress on my studying of python for the last 2 months, where I tried to make a useful and easily  understandable program that could manipulate IP Address and Sub-networking mask. Still, I called some friends to help me integrate my code to the front-end. If it happens, I will put that here. I hope you enjoyed playing with IP Address, thanks for visiting my project! :)

_file "main.py" is the one to be used in terminal, which means there are some commands to make it looks prettier there, like changing colors and skipping lines. 

_file "pureCode.py" is the one with only the commands necessary to make it works properly.
