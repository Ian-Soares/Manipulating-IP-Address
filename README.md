# Manipulating-IP-Address
This project contains some of my progress on my studying of python for the last 2 months, where I tried to make an useful and easily  understandable program that could manipulate IP Address and Sub-networking mask. Still, I called some friends to help me integrate my code to the front-end. If it happens, I will put that here. I hope you enjoyed playing with IP Address, thanks for visiting my project! :)

File "main.py" is the one to be used in terminal, which means there are some commands to make it looks prettier there, like changing colors and skipping lines. 

File "pureCode.py" is the one with only the necessary commands to make it works properly.
